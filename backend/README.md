## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup environment**

   ```bash
   cp ../env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   ```

3. **Start database**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up postgres -d
   ```

4. **Run migrations**

   ```bash
   npm run migration:up
   ```

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:3001/api`

## Challenges and Caveats

This project encountered several significant technical challenges during development. Here's a comprehensive overview of the difficulties faced and how they were resolved:

### 1. MikroORM Jest Integration Issues

**Challenge**: The `Map.prototype.set` error in Jest with MikroORM

- **Symptoms**: Tests failing with `TypeError: Map.prototype.set called on incompatible receiver`
- **Root Cause**: Incompatibility between Jest's `globalSetup`/`globalTeardown` and MikroORM's internal Map usage
- **Solution**: Removed `globalSetup` from Jest configuration and moved database setup to `setupFilesAfterEnv` using standard `beforeAll()` hooks
- **Result**: Sequential tests improved from 0/64 to 64/64 passing

### 2. Parallel Testing Architecture

**Challenge**: Implementing reliable parallel test execution

- **Symptoms**: Foreign key constraint violations and entity relationship conflicts
- **Root Cause**: Each Jest worker gets an isolated database, but factories used hardcoded IDs that don't exist across different worker databases
- **Approach**: Built comprehensive parallel testing infrastructure with:
  - Worker-aware database configuration
  - Isolated factory providers per worker
  - Clean architectural separation in `test/parallel/` directory
- **Current Status**:
  - ‚úÖ Sequential tests: 64/64 passing
  - üî∂ Parallel tests: Partially working but still encountering foreign key issues

### 3. Database Test Isolation

**Challenge**: Ensuring clean database state between tests

- **Initial Approach**: Transaction-based isolation with rollbacks
- **Problems**: Complex nested transaction management and potential deadlocks
- **Final Solution**: Database cleanup using dynamic table discovery
  - Query PostgreSQL metadata to get all user tables automatically
  - Disable foreign key constraints during cleanup
  - Re-enable constraints after cleanup
- **Benefits**: Maintainable, reliable, and automatically adapts to schema changes

### 4. Entity Factory Complexity

**Challenge**: Managing test data creation across different test environments

- **Evolution**:
  1. Started with hardcoded seeding
  2. Moved to complex factory hierarchies
  3. Implemented Factory Provider pattern for clean separation
- **Final Architecture**:
  - Simple factories focused only on entity creation
  - Centralized logic in `factory-provider.ts` for environment-aware behavior
  - Tests use clean `context.factories.createUser()` API without knowing about parallel/sequential modes

### 5. MikroORM Global Context Issues

**Challenge**: `RequestContext` and global context conflicts in tests

- **Solution**: Set `allowGlobalContext: true` for test environments
- **Configuration**: Environment-aware context handling in MikroORM config

### 6. Test Performance and Reliability

**Challenge**: Balancing test speed with reliability

- **Considerations**:
  - Sequential tests: Slower but 100% reliable
  - Parallel tests: Faster but complex database isolation requirements
- **Approach**: Dual configuration supporting both modes:

  ```bash
  # Sequential (reliable)
  npm run test

  # Parallel (experimental)
  npm run test:parallel
  ```

### 7. Database Migration Management

**Challenge**: Ensuring consistent schema across environments

- **Solution**: Comprehensive migration strategy with:
  - Transactional migrations
  - All-or-nothing approach
  - Separate test database initialization
  - Environment-aware entity path resolution

### Key Lessons Learned

1. **Jest + ORM Integration**: Always use `setupFilesAfterEnv` instead of `globalSetup` for database ORMs
2. **Test Isolation**: Database cleanup is more reliable than transaction rollbacks for integration tests
3. **Parallel Testing**: Requires careful architecture and may not always be worth the complexity
4. **Factory Patterns**: Clean separation between data creation and environment logic reduces complexity
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build sequential tests first, then add parallel testing as an optional feature

### Architecture Decisions

- **Clean Separation**: All parallel-specific code isolated in `test/parallel/`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Main test suite remains simple and reliable
- **Environment Detection**: Smart configuration based on `NODE_ENV` and `JEST_WORKER_ID`
- **Documentation First**: Comprehensive documentation for complex testing infrastructure
